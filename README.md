#Gameplay

- Mining Walls and Gold Provides Exp
- Fortifying walls provides them with more health, and when an enemy attempts to destroy they suffer damage as a result
- Claiming tiles('v') changes them to your color, and allows turrets to be placed on them
- Level gains currently speed up the mining speed(more bonuses will be added)
- Destroy the other player(s) core(s) to win the game
