#Mine - Mania Developer: Mr.McGee

This is something I made from just practice programming in C++
Over time it developed into something bigger.

This is a grid based game where the player can mine the 'Walls', and 'Gold' to gain money.
With money you can buy turrets/ammo.
The player can shoot.
Placing walls doesn't cost anything atm.
I've been working on Multiplayer for a while. It works right now, you can see the other player, them moving around etc.
